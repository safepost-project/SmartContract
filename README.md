<strong>SafePost</strong> is an encrypted messaging platform that <strong>keeps the privacy of its users safe</strong> by proposing a strong and efficient alternative to emails.

 

With SafePost, <strong>no more SPAM, scammer mails, phishing mails, spyware and other malware, </strong> and no more data transfer and storage duration limit!

 

Messages and documents are encrypted before being sent to SafePost. They are then stored in a decentralized SafePost database accessible in high availability.

 

SafePost uses open source libraries to encrypt and decrypt messages and documents: <strong>this gives the guarantee that algorithms used have no back door.</strong>

 

<strong>No ads, no statistics.</strong> Messages and documents remain confidential: <strong>NO THIRD PARTY, including the SafePost team, can neither decrypt nor read them!</strong>

 

SafePost proposes an ERC20 token whose name is STAMP.
